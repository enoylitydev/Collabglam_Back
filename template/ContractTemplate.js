COLLABGLAM MASTER BRAND–INFLUENCER AGREEMENT (TRI-PARTY)

Effective Date: {{Agreement.EffectiveDateLong}}

This Master Brand–Influencer Agreement (the “Agreement”) is made as of {{Agreement.EffectiveDate}} (the “Effective Date”) by and among: (i) {{Brand.LegalName}}, with its principal place of business at {{Brand.Address}} (“Brand”); (ii) {{Influencer.LegalName}}, with its principal place of business at {{Influencer.Address}} (“Influencer”); and (iii) CollabGlam or CollabGlam.com, with its principal place of business at {{CollabGlam.Address}} (“CollabGlam”). Each of Brand, Influencer, and CollabGlam is a “Party” and together the “Parties.”

1. Purpose; Scope; Territory; Relationship
   a. Purpose. CollabGlam provides a platform connecting brands and influencers for promotional content on social media including YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok (the “Channels”). This Agreement governs rights and obligations for each engagement documented in Schedule A (each, an “SOW”).
   b. Scope. This Agreement applies solely to the Channels. No other platforms are included unless added by written amendment executed by all Parties.
   c. Territory. Unless the SOW states otherwise, the territory is worldwide.
   d. Independent Contractor Status. Influencer is an independent contractor. No employment, partnership, joint venture, or agency is created.

2. Definitions; Language; Precedence; Time Standard
   a. Definitions. Capitalized terms have the meanings set out in Schedule E (Definitions).
   b. Language and Precedence. English governs. If any conflict exists, this Agreement prevails over any SOW, except where the SOW expressly overrides a non-locked topic. All Schedules are incorporated.
   c. Time Standard. Deadlines use {{Time.StandardTimezone}}. “Business Day” means a day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or public holiday in {{Time.StandardJurisdiction}}.

3. Formation of SOW; Versioning; Change Orders
   a. Formation. An SOW is formed when Brand completes required fields in the platform, Influencer accepts, Brand confirms acceptance, and the Parties execute via platform e-signature. If expressly enabled in the SOW, concurrent shipment of product and initial milestone payment constitutes acceptance.
   b. Versioning. The platform maintains immutable version history of offers, counteroffers, and acceptance.
   c. Change Orders. Any post-execution modification to Deliverables, schedules, or fees requires a written change order in the form set out in Schedule O.

4. Services; Deliverables; Acceptance; Makegoods
   a. Services and Deliverables. Influencer shall provide the services and the content specified in Schedule A (the “Deliverables”).
   b. Approvals. If pre-publication review is required, Influencer shall submit drafts via the platform. Brand shall respond within the review window in Schedule A. If Brand does not respond within such window, Influencer may issue a notice of deemed acceptance and proceed after two Business Days unless Brand objects in writing within that period.
   c. Revisions. Included revision rounds are as stated in Schedule A. Additional rounds are billable at the fee in Schedule A.
   d. Acceptance Criteria. A Deliverable is acceptable if it materially conforms to the SOW and Schedule B compliance standards. Minor non-material deviations shall not justify rejection.
   e. Makegoods. If a Deliverable misses the posting window due to Influencer fault, or is removed for non-compliance with Schedule B, Influencer shall, at no additional charge, provide a makegood consisting of re-posting within a mutually agreed window or an equivalent Deliverable.

5. Performance Standards; Escalation
   a. Service Levels. Submission and feedback timelines in Schedule A are binding.
   b. Escalation. Each Party shall designate an escalation contact in Schedule A. Unresolved issues escalate per the timelines in Schedule A.

   c. Derivative Edits. To the extent selected in Schedule K, Brand may create cut-downs, translations, captions, watermarks, thumbnails, and metadata edits.
   d. Raw Materials. If the SOW requires raw footage, project files, or working files, delivery shall occur per Schedule P. Ownership of raw materials remains with Influencer unless Schedule P expressly transfers ownership.
   e. Third-Party Materials. Influencer shall not include third-party materials requiring separate licenses without Brand’s prior written approval. Where approval is granted, proof of licenses shall be delivered per Schedule Q. Unless Schedule A shifts responsibility, Brand is responsible for commercial music licensing.
